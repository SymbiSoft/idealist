How to install IdeaList:

You've to have your phone hacked first using Drakarius, if you don't have a hacked phone yet go to point 0:

0. Start installing Drakkarious 3.01 FP1,FP2 & PreFP1.SiS

	a) screen will prompt you with 2 crosses on the screen u need to untick Prefp1 then carry on with the install this will install the files:

	CapsOn 
	CapsOff 
	HelloCarbide 
	X-plore 

	Dont worry about it its all fine.

	b) Once installed Run X-plore and press "0", tick the 4 boxes (dont un-tick if ticked already) 

	Without closing X-plore switch to the menu and run hellocarbide 

	Inside hellocarbide press options and chose Menu1 and answer "yes". 

	Go back to X-plore and extract installserver.exe and CProfDriver_SISX.ldd from your c:\hack.rar into c:\sys\bin 

	c) Restart your phone. 

	d) Run CapsOn
	
	Now your phone can install Unsigned files and no more expired certificate errors. (IdeaList for instance! :) )


If you have the latest PyS60 allready installed go straight to point 2

1. python.sis

2. idealist.sis

3. copy root.rar to your phone memory card and extract it to C: using X-plore
