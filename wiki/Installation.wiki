This short article will tell you how to install Idealist
I don't take responsibility for any unwanted effects of following this instruction.

== Requierements ==

 * S60v3 Nokia device (not known if it would work on other devices)
 * PyS60 1.38 and higher (currently IdeaList doesn't seem to work with 1.9 version)
 * Hacked symbian system.
 * IdeaList.rar package

== Details ==

 # You've got to get your phone hacked, so that idealist can use all the capabilities  of your symbian device. 
 # Install PyS60
 # Unrar IdeaList.rar
 # Install Idealist.sis on C: drive
 # Send root.rar to your phone memory and extract it (using Xplore for example) to your C:  drive, overwritting all the files.
 # Run Idealist

It needs so much efford to install, because basicly I don't have money to pay for the developer certificate.
