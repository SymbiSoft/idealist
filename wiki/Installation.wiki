#This short article will tell you how to install Idealist
I don't take responsibility for any unwanted effects of following this instruction.

= Requierements =

*S60v3 Nokia device (not known if it would work on other devices)
*PyS60 1.38 and higher (currently IdeaList doesn't seem to work with 1.9 version)
*Hacked symbian system.
*IdeaList.rar package

= Details =

0. You've got to get your phone hacked, so that idealist can use all the capabilities  of your symbian device. 
1. Install PyS60
2. Unrar IdeaList.rar
3. Install Idealist.sis. 
4. Send root.rar to your phone memory and extract it (using Xplore for example) to your C:  overwritting all the files.
5. Run Idealist

It needs so much efford to install, because basicly I don't have money to pay for the developer certificate.
