This short article will tell you how to install Idealist
I don't take responsibility for any unwanted effects of following this instruction.

## Requierements ##

  * S60v3 Nokia device (not known if it would work on other devices)
  * PyS60 1.38 and higher (currently IdeaList doesn't seem to work with 1.9 version)
  * Hacked symbian system.
  * IdeaList.rar package

## Details ##

  1. You've got to get your phone hacked, so that idealist can use all the capabilities  of your symbian device.
  1. Install PyS60
  1. Unrar IdeaList.rar
  1. Install Idealist.sis on C: drive
  1. Send root.rar to your phone memory and extract it (using Xplore for example) to your C:  drive, overwritting all the files.
  1. Run Idealist

It needs so much efford to install, because basicly I don't have money to pay for the developer certificate.
